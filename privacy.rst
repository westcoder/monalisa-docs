Privacy and data protection
===========================

Data protection
---------------
The topic of data protection is comprehensively regulated by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To help you understand which data we collect from you, how we process it, what we do to protect your data, and whom to contact if you have any questions, we’ve put together all the relevant information on this page.

Person responsible and scope
----------------------------
| The person responsible according to the GDPR is:

| Dr. Stefan Schumacher
| IFOTES Europe e.V.
| Dödterstraße 10
| 58095 Hagen
| Germany

| Telephone: +49 2331 17773
| Email: s.schumacher@ifotes.org


This privacy policy applies to our tool ``listening-skills.eu`` as well as to our documentation page ``docs.listening-skills.eu``.

We operate the service ``docs.listening-skills.eu`` outside of our own infrastructure at ReadTheDocs to be able to build and host the documentation of our tool. Please note the `privacy policy <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/privacy-policy.html>`_ of Read The Docs.


Principles of data processing
-----------------------------
Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, information such as your name, age, address, phone number, date of birth, e-mail address, IP address, or user behavior. Information that we can not relate to your person (or only with disproportionate effort), e.g. by anonymizing the information, are not personal information. The processing of personal data (eg. collecting, querying, using, storing or transmitting) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing has been achieved and no legally required retention requirements have to be maintained.

If we process your personal data for the purpose of providing certain offers, we will subsequently inform you of the specific transactions, the scope and purpose of the data processing, the legal basis for the processing and the respective retention period.

Use of our website
------------------
When using our websites, we may create web server logs that contain the date and time, the retrieved URL path, the referrer (if applicable) and the browser used; However, we anonymise your IP address using IP masking, so that we do not collect any personal data.

Use of cookies
--------------
We only set one cookie regarding the language of the tool: e.g. ``lang=en`` for a period of one year. So if you change the language away from the one we recognized from your first visit, we can present you the tool in the same language on the next visit. 

When you register or log in, we set a cookie that carries a session ID. This is technically mandatory to maintain your login status, and therefore requires no separate consent. The cookie is not stored persistently, but is automatically deleted when the browser window is closed.

Tracking and analysis tools
---------------------------
We do not use any external tracking and analysis tools.


Social network plugins
----------------------
We do not use any plugins of social networks.

Links
-----
You may occasionally find links to other websites on our website. By activating these links you will be redirected to the website of another operator, which you can recognize by the changed URL in the browser. We have no control over their content and therefore do not have any responsibility for how those other websites handle your personal information. We have not checked if the operators of those websites comply with the GDPR. Please inform yourself about it. (Hopefully that’s obvious, because that’s how the Internet works, but our lawyers thought we should write it down.)

Data subject rights
-------------------
As a person affected by the processing of personal data you have the following rights under GDPR, and we are obliged to point this out to you:

* Pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, you may request information about your personal data processed by us. In particular, you may request information about the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data, the categories of recipients to whom your data have been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the existence of a right of rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a right to lodge a complaint, the origin of your data, if it has not been collected from us, about its transfer to third countries or to international organisations as well as about the existence of automated decision-making including profiling and, if applicable, meaningful information about its details.
* Pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR you may request the correction of incorrect personal data or the completion of your personal data stored by us.
* Pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR, you may request the deletion of your personal data stored by us, unless such processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for the fulfilment of a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
* Pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR you can demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data if the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, we no longer require the data and you refuse its deletion because you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. You may also exercise the right under Art. 18 GDPR if you have objected to the processing. (Art. 21 GDPR)
* Pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, you can request to receive your personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, common and machine-readable format or you can request it be transferred to a third party.
* Pursuant to Art. 7 (3) GDPR, you can withdraw your consent given to us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process personal data based on this consent in the future.
* Pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority for your usual place of residence, your workplace or our company headquarters.

Right to object
---------------
When processing your personal data based on legitimate interests according to Art. 6 (1) f GDPR, you have the right, pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR, to object to the processing of your personal data on grounds that arise from your particular situation. Alternatively, if the objection is directed against direct marketing, you have a general right of objection, which is followed by us without you having to state a particular reason.

Data security and security measures
-----------------------------------
We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential. In order to avoid manipulation, loss or misuse of your data stored by us, we take extensive technical and organizational security precautions, which are regularly checked and adapted to technological progress. This includes, among other things, the use of recognized encryption procedures. However, we would like to point out that, due to the nature of the Internet, it is possible that the rules of data protection and the above-mentioned security measures may not be followed by other persons or institutions outside our area of responsibility. In particular, unencrypted data can be read by third parties - e.g. if sent via e-mail. We have no technical influence on this. It is your responsibility to protect the data provided by you against misuse, e. g. by utilizing encryption technology.
