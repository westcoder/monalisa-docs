Trainers
========


If you are a trainer and qualify people in the field of listening, you can use this web-application to individually assess the training success of your trainees and improve it through training.

- You can ask participants complete the self-assessment form, for example, at the beginning and end of a training session to monitor changes in self-assessment.
- The self-assessment provides information about the listening areas in which trainees feel confident or insecure, enabling you, to track and target your training according to individual needs of trainees.
- You can ask participants in a listening-skill training to practice specific case studies on selected listening areas, discuss and reflect on the response options and their effect in the group. Furthermore, additional, and more complex case studies can be unlocked.

How do I use the web application in training?
---------------------------------------------

Ask the participants in your training group to save their profile after completing the self-assessment test and have it emailed to them or take a photo of the QR code. Ask your participants to send you the code, and insert the code at the beginning of the application in the code-field. Then you can view the result of the questionnaire of each group participant and use it for the adaptation of an individual training or make suggestions for targeted practice.

You also have the possibility to unlock additional case studies for your participants of a course, which are more challenging than the three basic examples.
To do this, ask your trainees to place a lowercase ``a`` in front of their profile code (``a`` stands for "advanced"). From that moment on, additional case studies will be displayed in the training section. (Example for the code: ``fz3mp`` and the extension: ``afz3mp``)
