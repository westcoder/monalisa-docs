"In many European member states, there are telephone or Internet-based "

"crisis services is to accompany these people, to provide them with "
"contact or a relationship, to support them emotionally, to provide "
"guidance and, if necessary, to limit the risk of suicide. Most crisis "
"services work with volunteers who are carefully trained over a period of "
"several months for this responsible activity."
