Introduction
============
In many European member states, there are telephone or Internet-based crisis services for people in distress, with suicidal intent, various mental health problems and many life-limiting problems. The task of the crisis services is to accompany these people, to provide them with contact or a relationship, to relieve them emotionally, to provide orientation and, if necessary, to absorb suicidal crises. Most crisis services work with volunteers who are carefully prepared over a period of months for this responsible activity.

According to the International Association of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES), there are about 350 crisis centers in Europe with over 20,000 volunteers providing emergency assistance day and night with over 4 million phone calls and over 100,000 internet contacts. Every year 2-3 thousand volunteers need to be trained to maintain the emergency service around the clock. Recruiting volunteers is complex and costly, and ongoing training is required. The core competency for crisis response is listening.

Against this background, 8 partners from 5 EU Member States have joined together in an interdisciplinary consortium to expand existing knowledge on listening skills more individually, to study the architecture of listening, to measure people's competencies and their ability to listen with their hearts, and to provide new attitudes towards the technique and art of competent listening.

The strategic partnership of the Erasmus+ program "MonaLisa" (Measurement of nowadays advanced Listening-Skills attitudes) was funded by EU funds and consisted of six Telephone Emergency Services (TES) from DE, IT, HU, FR, and ES, a research center specialized in emotional and mental health (DE), a training provider and consultant in the field of social skills, competence assessment and career guidance (IT), and a developer of digital platform solutions (DE).

The outcome of the project is a questionnaire for self-assessment of one's listening skills, the presentation of the result across eight different listening fields, and an exercise program that uses case studies to train sensitivity in listening in the eight listening fields. 

The online tool is available free of charge and can be easily integrated into existing websites. The aim of the consortium is to highlight the relevance of listening skills for social interaction throughout Europe in different languages and to stimulate an intensive learning-based examination of one's own listening skills.
