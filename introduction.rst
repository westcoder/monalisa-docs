Introduction
============
In all European Member States there are telephone or Internet-based crisis helplines for people in need, with suicidal intentions, diverse mental health problems and many life-limiting problems. The task of crisis services is to accompany those people, to provide contact or relationship, to relieve them emotionally, to give orientation and, if necessary, to absorb suicidal crises. Most crisis services work with volunteers who are carefully prepared for this responsible activity for months.

According to the International Association of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES), there are about 350 crisis centers in Europe with over 20,000 volunteers providing emergency assistance day and night in over 4 million telephone calls and over 100.000 internet contacts. 2-3 thousand volunteers have to be trained every year to keep the crisis helpline around the clock. The recruitment of volunteers is complex and costly and ongoing training is needed. The core competence for crisis support is listening.

Against this background, 9 partners from 6 EU Member States have joined in an interdisciplinary consortium with the aim to expand the existing knowledge about listening skills more individually, to study the architecture of listening, to measure the competences of human beings and their ability to heart-listen, and to give new attitudes about the technique and art of competent listening.

The Strategic Partnership consist of 6 Telephone Emergency Services (TES) from DE, IT, HU, FR, NL, ES, one research center specialised in emotional and mental health (DE), a training provider and consultancy in the field of social skills, skills assessment and vocational guidance (IT) and a developer of digital platform solutions (DE).
